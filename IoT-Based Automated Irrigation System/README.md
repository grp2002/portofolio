# 🌿 Automatic Plant Irrigation System with User-Controlled Mobile Interface

**Dissertation Project | University of Liverpool | Awarded First-Class Honours**

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **BEng Computer Science & Electronic Engineering** dissertation and was awarded a **First-Class** grade. It focuses on creating an **Arduino-based automated irrigation system** that uses **soil moisture sensors** to intelligently manage plant watering. The system is remotely controlled and monitored via a custom-built **React Native mobile app**.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Real-Time Moisture Monitoring:** Instant updates on soil moisture levels.  
- **Automated Watering:** Activates the water pump when moisture drops below a set threshold.  
- **Mobile Control:** Manual pump activation and threshold configuration via a mobile app.  
- **Proxy Server:** Seamless data exchange between the Arduino system and the mobile app.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev 2, Soil Moisture Sensor, Water Pump  
- **Software:** React Native (Mobile App), Node.js (Proxy Server)  
- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grp2002/portfolio.git
