## üìñ Project Overview

The **IoT-Based Automated Irrigation System** is designed to automate plant watering using real-time data from **soil moisture sensors**. This smart system reduces water waste by intelligently controlling the water pump based on environmental conditions. The system is remotely monitored and controlled through a custom-built **React Native mobile app**.

## üîß Key Features

- **Real-Time Moisture Monitoring:** Continuously checks soil moisture levels.  
- **Automated Watering:** Activates the water pump when the soil is dry.  
- **Manual Control:** Allows users to manually control the pump through a mobile app.  
- **Threshold Configuration:** Users can set custom moisture thresholds for watering.  
- **Cloud Integration:** Synchronizes data between hardware and the mobile app through a proxy server.
