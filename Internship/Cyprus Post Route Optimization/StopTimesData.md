- # Stop Times Data - Cyprus Post Route Optimization

## 📌 Overview
This section contains the **Stop Times** dataset, which was collected during real-world testing with postmen. The data represents the time spent at various stops during delivery routes, providing insights for optimizing postal routes.

## 📂 Folder Contents
- `stop_times.csv` – The main dataset containing timestamps and stop durations.
- `analysis_notebook.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook used for analyzing the stop time data.

## 📊 Data Description
The dataset consists of the following key columns:

| Column Name      | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Stop_ID`       | Unique identifier for each stop                 |
| `Route_ID`      | Identifier for the route the stop belongs to    |
| `Arrival_Time`  | Time the postman arrived at the stop            |
| `Departure_Time`| Time the postman left the stop                  |
| `Duration`      | Time spent at the stop (calculated in minutes)  |
| `Latitude`      | Geographic latitude of the stop                 |
| `Longitude`     | Geographic longitude of the stop                |

## 🚀 Analysis & Findings
Key insights from the collected data:
- **Average Stop Time:** 📌 The average stop duration per location.
- **Peak Time Analysis:** ⏰ Identifying the busiest periods in the route.
- **Route Efficiency:** 🛣️ Understanding which routes have excessive delays.
- **Optimization Suggestions:** ✨ Recommendations for reducing overall delivery time.

## 📈 Visualizations
Visualizations help in understanding the dataset better. Some key plots included:
- **Stop Duration Histogram:** Distribution of stop times.
- **Route Efficiency Line Graph:** Comparison of different routes.
- **Geospatial Heatmap:** Identifying clusters of high stop durations.
