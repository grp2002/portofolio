# Route Optimization & Stop Time Analysis for Cyprus Post

## üìå Overview
This document presents the analysis of postal collection routes for optimizing travel efficiency. The project involved:
- Collecting **GPS location data** from a mobile tracking application.
- Identifying **stop locations** where postmen spent time collecting letters.
- **Optimizing routes** to reduce travel time and increase efficiency.
- **Visualizing** real-world vs. optimized routes.
- **Data analysis performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook** for route optimization and statistical evaluation.

## üìÇ Data Collection & Processing
### üí° How the Data Was Collected
1. **GPS tracking** recorded the postman's location **every second**, storing **latitude, longitude, and timestamps**.
2. Stops were identified where **the postman remained stationary** near pillar boxes.
3. The collected data was processed to:
   - **Remove GPS noise** (minor deviations due to signal errors).
   - **Detect stops** based on time spent at a location.
   - **Compare real-world vs. optimized routes**.

### üìà Dataset Structure
| Column Name      | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Stop_ID`       | Unique identifier for each stop                 |
| `Route_ID`      | Identifier for the optimized route              |
| `Arrival_Time`  | Timestamp when the postman arrived at a stop    |
| `Departure_Time`| Timestamp when the postman left a stop          |
| `Duration`      | Time spent at the stop (minutes)                |
| `Latitude`      | Geographic latitude of the stop                 |
| `Longitude`     | Geographic longitude of the stop                |
| `Optimized_Route` | Suggested sequence for best efficiency       |

## üåç Route Visualization
### **1. Raw GPS Route**
- **First map**: Shows the **unprocessed route**, directly plotted from raw latitude-longitude data.
- **Dense and jagged**, as it captures every second of movement.

### **2. Smoothed GPS Route**
- **Second map**: A **cleaned version** of the route using data smoothing techniques.
- **Removes small deviations**, making analysis easier and more accurate.

## üîç Analysis & Findings
### **Stop Time Statistics**
- **Bar charts** illustrate:
  - **Average stop duration** across all locations.
  - **Standard deviation**, showing variation in stop times.

- **Outlier detection**:
  - **Red points** in scatter plots show abnormally long stops.
  - Helps **identify inefficiencies** (e.g., delays due to traffic, manual errors, or unoptimized collection points).

### **Route Efficiency Evaluation**
- **Comparison of actual vs. optimized routes**:
  - Identifies **unnecessary detours**.
  - Evaluates **potential time savings** with optimized routing.
- **Recalculated stop times after adjustments**:
  - A second analysis after **removing outliers** gives a **more accurate efficiency estimate**.

## üåü Key Takeaways
- **Route Optimization:**
  - Reduces total collection time.
  - Minimizes unnecessary stops and improves efficiency.
- **Data Smoothing & Outlier Removal:**
  - Helps refine travel patterns for **better route planning**.
- **Visual Insights:**
  - Allow real-time tracking of collection patterns.
  - Support decision-making for **future route planning improvements**.
