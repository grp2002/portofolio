# 📦 Cyprus Post Route Optimization System

**Internship Project | Cyprus Research & Innovation Centre (CyRIC)**

## 📖 Project Overview

As part of my internship at **CyRIC**, I contributed to the development of a **Route Optimization System** for the Cyprus Post Office. The system aimed to streamline delivery operations by optimizing postman routes, reducing delivery time, and improving operational efficiency.

## 🔧 My Contributions

- **Algorithm Enhancement:** Improved the performance of the route optimization logic by refining data handling and integration.  
- **Mobile App Development:** Implemented new features for **real-time tracking** and **data validation** in the mobile app.  
- **Sensor Monitoring System:** Developed a **Java-based monitoring tool** to track sensor activity and send **automated email notifications**.  
- **Data Analysis Automation:** Created tools to automate performance data analysis, reducing manual workload. [Stop Times Data Documentation](StopTimesData.md).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Java, Python  
- **Database:** MySQL/XAMPP  
- **Technologies:** Mobile App Development, Automation Tools, Email Notifications

## 🚀 Project Impact

- Reduced delivery inefficiencies through optimized route planning.  
- Automated monitoring processes, cutting down on manual checks.  
- Streamlined system validation with automated data analysis scripts.
